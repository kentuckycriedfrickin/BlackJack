        Here are the rules! 
        The objective is to close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
        It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. 
        Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
        Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, 
        in front of them in the designated area.
        Minimum and maximum limits are established on the betting,
        and the general limits are from $2 to $500.
        You go first and must decide whether to
        "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" 
        (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, 
        or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards
        originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional 
        cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total 
        (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). 
        In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects 
        the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to 
        their left and serves them in the same manner.
        If the player and dealer have equal unbusted totals the
        hand is considered a push and the playerâ€™s bet is returned.
        If a player wins a hand they are paid out at 1:1 on the total bet wagered
        on that hand. For example if the player wagered $10 and then doubled down
        placing a further bet of $10 on the hand and won, they would be paid a 
        total of $40, their $20 bet back and $20 winnings.
        If the player has Blackjack they are paid at 3:2, so that a wager of $10
        the player would be paid a total of $25, their $10 bet back plus $15 winnings.
